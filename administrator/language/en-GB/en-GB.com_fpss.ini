FPSS_FETCH_DATA_FROM_3RD_PARTY_EXTENSION_AT_RUNTIME_DESC="When this option is enabled, Frontpage Slideshow fetches content linked to third-party extensions (like K2, Virtuemart etc.) directly. This means that when you change e.g. a K2 item, which also happens to be linked to a slideshow, the content displayed in the slideshow is automatically updated. If this option is disabled, the Frontpage Slideshow component will fetch and store and third-party content only when a slide is created or edited. The second option is highly recommended on high traffic websites."
